## Introduction
Distance measurement using HC-SR04 and ATMEGA328p. In this project we are measuring distance in centimetres, with the help of HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor, ATMEGA328p microcontroller, LCD Display.

## SWOT Analysis
-   This sensor can scan for objects upto 400cm.
-   It can be used to find distance between two objects if both objects are in direct line of sight.
-   This sensor cannot scan objects which are over 400cm away from its direct line of sight.
-   It doesn't take too much power for operating.

__High level requiremetns__
| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| HLR1 | Needs direct line of sight to work | 

__Low level requirements__
| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| LLR1 | Needs air as a medium |
